            <h2>What we do</h2>

            <p><b>BASIK</b> was setup in 2006 to help fund education in Kenya. All money raised by the charity is used
                to provide schools with necessities such as running water, sanitation blocks, desks and a building that
                lasts.</p>

            <p>The majority of children in Kenya are coming to schools in very poor conditions. There are no school
                meals, drinking water, toilets and some schools are falling into disrepair.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="grid-4">
            <h2>Where we do it</h2>

            <p><b>BASIK</b> is currently building Kilimani School, near Mombassa, Kenya. We arrived at Kilimani in 2006
                and adopted the school as <b>BASIK</b>'s first project.</p>

            <p>The school was a mud hut in a remote area in the middle of several villages. One man and a female helper
                were trying to teach 80 local children of primary school age on a site with no water or sanitary
                facilities and no teaching resources. In the rainy season, it was impossible to use the hut due to the
                leaking roof and mud floor.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="grid-4">
            <h2>Who we are</h2>

            <p>Based in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, <b>BASIK</b> is a family run charity that relies on the dedication and
                support of friends and volunteers. We organise regional fundraising events, including an annual cycling
                challenge.</p>

            <p>If you would like to find out more or get involved with the charity, please email Chris or Celia.</p>
