                <h2>Our first project, Kilimani</h2>

                <p>BASIK began life in 2006 when we started raising money to fund the rebuilding of Kilimani Primary
                    School.</p>

                <p>The school was a mud hut in a rural location outside Mombasa, with two teachers supporting 70
                    students.
                    It had no basic facilities and materials. We worked with Head Teacher Julius Nzai to rebuild the
                    school
                    and support children who couldn't afford to pay their fees to get an education.</p>

                <p>Kilimani now has brick built classrooms for all year groups, a staff room, toilets, clean running
                    water and more teachers to provide a better quality education. The school now supports over 150
                    students from the local community! This was our first project as a charity and we're very proud of
                    what we helped to achieve at Kilimani and the opportunities the students will gain from an
                    education.</p>
            </li>

            <li class="grid-6">
                <h2>Our current project</h2>

                <p>We are now working in partnership with Simon Musila and the Tsavo East Community Development
                    Initiative. TECDI are a community organisation in Kenya that like us are hoping to educate children
                    as a long-term solution to fight poverty. Simon runs the initiative in his spare time to try and
                    help his community. They have started a community library and museum as well as coming together to
                    support children with their school fees. They do this around the Tsavo East National Park in the
                    Kasaala disctrict.</p>

                <p>If you would like to find out more or get involved with the charity, please email Chris or Celia.</p>
